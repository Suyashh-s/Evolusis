## AI Reasoning and Decision-Making Engine

### Tool Selection Algorithm

The system employs LangChain's tool-calling agent architecture to analyze user queries and intelligently select appropriate tools for execution. The decision-making process ensures optimal resource utilization and response accuracy.

**Available Tools:**
1. **get_weather()** - Retrieves real-time meteorological data
2. **get_news()** - Fetches current news articles and events
3. **search_wikipedia()** - Accesses encyclopedic and factual information

### Decision Flow Architecture

### Example: Query Processing Workflow

**User Query:** "What is the weather in Paris today?"

**Processing Steps:**
1. **Intent Recognition** - System identifies weather-related query
2. **Tool Selection** - Invokes `get_weather("Paris")` function
3. **Data Retrieval** - Fetches real-time data from OpenWeatherMap API
4. **Reasoning Integration** - Combines factual data with contextual analysis
5. **Response Synthesis** - Generates professional, coherent answer

**System Output:**

## Demonstration Video

**Video Walkthrough:** [Watch on Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/4e87ee3302524e3f985284d8717fa067)

**Content Coverage:**
1. System architecture and design overview
2. **Weather query demonstration** - Shows both scenarios:
   - With OpenWeatherMap API (successful weather data retrieval)
   - Without API/API failure (Gemini uses built-in knowledge as fallback)
3. General knowledge queries (historical facts, geography)
4. Conversation memory demonstration
5. Speech input and output features
6. Code walkthrough of key components
7. Testing and validation procedures

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes (as per assignment requirements)

**Note:** The video demonstrates the intelligent fallback mechanism where the system uses OpenWeatherMap API for weather queries, and relies on Gemini's built-in knowledge for all other queries including news, facts, and general information.
